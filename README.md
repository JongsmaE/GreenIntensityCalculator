# GreenIntensityCalculator
This program calculates the total intensity of green pixels in an image or ROI. The program is optimized for C. elegans images collected with a tripple band filter in which the auto-fluorescence of the gut is yellow. Autofluorescence is ignored by only counting pixel values if Green pixel intensity > Red pixel intensity.
